# Read Meat Quality Assessment Using Deep Learning (CNN Model)

## Overview
In this project, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model was developed to assess the quality of red meat using deep learning techniques. The dataset used in the project consisted of images of meat with two classes - fresh and spoiled. The aim of the project was to build a CNN model that could be used in the real world to accurately classify the quality of red meat.
The model was trained on the dataset using various layers, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, to extract features from the input images and classify them into their respective classes. The model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy to assess its performance.
The final CNN model achieved an impressive accuracy of 97%, indicating its potential usefulness in real-world applications. The results of this project suggest that deep learning techniques, such as CNNs, can be effective in assessing the quality of red meat and may have applications in the food industry to improve food safety and reduce waste.

## The Dataset
This dataset contains 2 classes, fresh and spoiled red meat samples collected from a supermarket in Izmir, Turkey for a university-industry collaboration project at Izmir University of Economics, and this work was published in ASYU 2019.

This dataset was collected in order to develop a meat quality assessment system which is based on deep learning. All of the experimental results which are explained in the paper, prove the usability of our dataset and our model can successfully distinguish between the classes with high accuracy.
Images were collected via an IP camera and the resolution of the images are 1280 x 720. There are 1896 images in total, 948 per class.

## Results
The CNN model achieved a 97% of accuracy. In the following image you can take a look of some the predictions results.
